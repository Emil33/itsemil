      <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I’m a front-end focused software engineer with over 5 years of experience developing modern, responsive,
        and high-performing web applications. I specialise in JavaScript, React, and SAPUI5, with a strong
        background in UI/UX and performance optimisation.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        My journey began in SAP development — creating enterprise-grade solutions using ABAP, OData, and Fiori
        Design Guidelines. Today, I’m expanding my expertise into React and TypeScript, building modern,
        component-based UIs with Tailwind CSS and RESTful APIs.
